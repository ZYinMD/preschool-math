# instructions for Github Actions to deploy static site to GitHub Pages.

# To find docs on how to do it, first go to github repo > settings > pages > Source > Github actions > Static HTML > Configure, it'll show you a template yaml. Then modify it by checking https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy#github-pages or google "vite deploy static sites". Can also google "pnpm github actions" if encounter pnpm issues.
